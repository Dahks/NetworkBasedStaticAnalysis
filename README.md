# NetBaStA (Network Based Static Analysis)
> NOTE still in progress.

## Future concept
Using Network Science for static analysis.
Generate a graph view of your (currently only python) functions with proposed statistics on frequency of calls.
Integrating this feature with your logs creates an even better summary.
This way you can easily find hot paths to focus on in refactors.

# Use
To use the library as a CLI tool, run
```
python3 netbasta {filename}
```

where filename is a valid filename or abolute path on your machine
